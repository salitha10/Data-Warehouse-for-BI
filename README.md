# Data-Warehouse-for-BI
This is a project done for DWBI module of the Data Science program at SLIIT. 

## Introduction
In corporate environment data is an essential component. In modern days data has become one of the most valuable assets. 
Since millions of data are generated each day, it has become a challenge to handle enormous amount of data and obtain fruitful insights from them. 
The Datawarehouse concept is crucial for processing enormous amounts of corporate data. This project demonstrates the architecture, implementation, and ETL procedure of the “Instacart dataset”. 
This main objective of this project is to develop and deliver a data warehouse for business usage. This will aid in the storage and processing of company data.

## Data Source
The Instacart DataMart Analysis dataset found on Kaggle is used in this project. To adapt to the given context, 
I added additional datasets to increase the complexity of the Datawarehouse.

➢ Main Dataset – https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/data

➢ Customer Data generated from – https://www.onlinedatagenerator.com/

➢ Ratings dataset was developed using Excel

## Design and Development
Initially facts and dimensions were identified before implementing the warehouse. Snowflake schema was used to avoid data redundancy. 
The order table was taken as the fact table, which contains data from retail transactions.

## Tools used
* Visual Studio 2017

* SQL Server

* SQL Server Management Studio

* SQL Server Reporting Services
